**April 4, 2025:**

**Discussion Topics:**

- Discuss the pathiline for the proejct
    - practice -> real data; same idea larger scale
- Discuss the ML model for the 21cmVAE
- Discuss what are error curves- https://wandb.ai/mostafaibrahim17/ml-articles/reports/A-Deep-Dive-Into-Learning-Curves-in-Machine-Learning--Vmlldzo0NjA1ODY0
- What is the Overall Goal? We want to emulate curves from the 21cm signal
- Training data is 80% of all data and testing data is 20% of all data

**Assignments:**

1. Look at the ML for the 21cmVAE
2. Send the code for the training data generation
3. Using training Data from file *Practice Training Data Outputs* make a ML that can accurately predict the value of Y based on random values of A, b, and x

Some Notes:

MAE(Mean Absolute Error)- Calculates the average absolute difference between predicted and actual values, more resistnat to outliers.

MSE(Mean Squared Error)- Calculates the average of the squared differences between predicted and actual values, very sensitive to outliers.
